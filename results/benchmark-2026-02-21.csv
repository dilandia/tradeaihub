# NOTE: getTradeCount p95=615ms is a transient network spike. Re-run (15 iterations) showed avg=243ms with 14/15 under 260ms.
# NOTE: deleteImport_cascade_read involves 2 sequential queries (count trades + read import summary) so ~580ms avg is expected (2x RTT).
# NOTE: tagFilter was skipped because 0 trades have tags assigned. Re-run after adding tagged test data.
# NOTE: Tested with 155 trades. Re-run with 10K+ trades for Phase 5.1 verification.
